## Description

_This website is meant to display my portfolio. It contains an about me where I say what my interests, hobbies, and skills are. It has my projects I'm working on so far at Epicodus laid out in card style. It also contains some background information about me, including why I want to go into programming. There's also a gallery that I tried implementing until I realized I needed JavaScript to run it. All of this can be accessed by the nav which sticks to the page when you scroll down._
